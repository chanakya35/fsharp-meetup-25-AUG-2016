Coding Dojo: Theseus and Minotaur

This turned out to be only a quasi-dojo and more of a build-along.  Sorry about that.

The file Dojo.txt is the script to follow that will take you through the entire process.  
It assumes you get around your IDE already.

The file SampleSolution.fs is just that: a complete sample solution that can be compiled and run.
It was built along with the Dojo.txt text and might help clarify any confusion as to how things are put together
as a whole.

The file lame_labyrinth.data is the data file for the labyrinth.  It can be read in any text editor.  If you modify it, be
sure to update the width/height values in the program (or, as suggested later in the project, infer these from the data
file itself).

This code repository is property of the Portal FSharp Meetup Group (http://www.meetup.com/Portland-F-Meetup-Group/) 
and is provided as-is with no warranties and/or guarantees.
If you want to use the code for your own quasi-dojo/build-along, just give us a heads up and also consider coming out sometime
and visiting your fellow FSharpers here in Portland sometime.  We're always looking for guest speakers ;)
